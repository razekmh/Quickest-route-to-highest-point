# Quickest route to highest point
Python code to find the quickest route to the highest point within a radius of 5 km circle around the entry point. The Code was built as part of the assessment for the geospatial programming module. 

The code is presented in two Jupyter notebooks as required by the assessment rules. One of the notebooks hold the code _main.ipynb_ while the other serve as interface _interface.ipynb_. The code was developed and sumbitted by [@Ibrahim2311 Ibrahim Alhadidi](https://github.com/Ibrahim2311) and myself.
