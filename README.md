# Quickest route to highest point
Python code to find the quickest route to the highest point within a radius of 5 km circle around the entry point. The Code was built as part of the assessment for the geospatial programming module. 

The code is presented in two Jupyter notebooks as required by the assessment rules. One of the notebooks hold the code [main.ipynb](https://github.com/razekmh/Quickest-route-to-highest-point/blob/master/main.ipynb) while the other serve as interface [interface.ipynb](https://github.com/razekmh/Quickest-route-to-highest-point/blob/master/interface.ipynb). The code was developed and submitted by [@Ibrahim2311 Ibrahim Alhadidi](https://github.com/Ibrahim2311) and myself.

## Initial prompt
The program is deigned to help in a emergency situation where an extreme flood is taking place on the Isle of Wight. To help residents escape the danger the authorities advise that they proceed on foot to the highest point on land within a radius of 5 km. 

The authorities provided the developers with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the island, road network,  Integrated Transport Network (ITN) file and a raster map of the island.
